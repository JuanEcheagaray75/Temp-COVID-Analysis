# Temp-COVID-Analysis

Temporary repository to host the notebook files used to create an statistical analysis on mexican COVID data base

Run the jupyter file in this repo to see the analysis I made. Here's a list of all the modules you'll need to run it:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
4. sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
5. sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score
6. scipy.stats
7. basic_stats

basic_stats is a module I made for onw of my statistic courses, it heavily relies on the scipy.stats module. You don't really need to use my functions, I just made them to be more readable to me.
